# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, or applications. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Purpose

This skill guides the creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. It implements real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

Users provide frontend requirements such as: components, pages, applications, or interfaces to build, potentially with context about purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

### Key Considerations:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?

2. **Tone**: Pick an extreme:
   - Brutally minimal
   - Maximalist chaos
   - Retro-futuristic
   - Organic/natural
   - Luxury/refined
   - Playful/toy-like
   - Editorial/magazine
   - Brutalist/raw
   - Art deco/geometric
   - Soft/pastel
   - Industrial/utilitarian

   Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.

3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)

4. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

### Critical Principle:
**Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision.** Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

### Implementation Requirements:

Implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Focus Areas:

#### **Typography**
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter
- Opt for distinctive, characterful choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

#### **Color & Theme**
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes

#### **Motion**
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals (animation-delay)
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

#### **Spatial Composition**
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry
- Overlap
- Diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

#### **Backgrounds & Visual Details**
- Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors
- Add contextual effects and textures matching the overall aesthetic
- Apply creative forms such as:
  - Gradient meshes
  - Noise textures
  - Geometric patterns
  - Layered transparencies
  - Dramatic shadows
  - Decorative borders
  - Custom cursors
  - Grain overlays

### What to Avoid (Generic AI Aesthetics):

**NEVER use:**
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

### Key Principles:

1. **Interpret creatively** and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context
2. **No design should be the same** — vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics
3. **NEVER converge on common choices** (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations
4. **Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision**:
   - Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
   - Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
   - Elegance comes from executing the vision well

### Final Note:

**Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back—show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.**
